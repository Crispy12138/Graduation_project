## Neural Network Modeling for Model Predictive Control of Nonlinear Chemical Processes

### Project Overview
This project explores the application of **machine learning-based nonlinear modeling** for chemical process control. Traditional **linear empirical models** often fall short in capturing the **nonlinear dynamics** of chemical processes, making **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** less effective. To address this, this study investigates **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models** as alternatives for **nonlinear process modeling**, particularly in a **Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)** system.
