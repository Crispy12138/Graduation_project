Neural Network Modeling for Model Predictive Control of Nonlinear Chemical Processes
Project Overview
This project explores the application of machine learning-based nonlinear modeling for chemical process control. Traditional linear empirical models often fall short in capturing the nonlinear dynamics of chemical processes, making model predictive control (MPC) less effective. To address this, this study investigates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models as alternatives for nonlinear process modeling, particularly in a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) system.
